## Practical Information

Some practical information to help you prepare for your visit.

### Weather

August is the warmest month of the year with the least rainfall: the average daytime temperature is around 19°C with a maximum of 29°C. 

However, the Plateau de Millevaches is located at an altitude of 700m, which means nights can be cool. Remember to bring a sweater or a light jacket.

### Dress code

There is no specific color theme for the wedding. You look great, come as you are!

The ground is mostly lawn; we recommend avoiding high heels, especially if the ground is damp.

### Wedding Registry
Your presence in Creuse is a gift in itself. If you wish to treat us further, you can find our wedding registry online at <a href="https://www.millemercismariage.com/carolineetlaurentj/liste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mille merci mariage</a>.
